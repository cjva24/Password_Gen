# Password Generator

## About 
as a developer I wanted to create a password generator using html, css, and javascript.

### User Story

#### AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
#### I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
#### SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

### Acceptance Criteria 

#### GIVEN I need a new, secure password
#### WHEN I click the button to generate a password
#### THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
#### WHEN prompted for password criteria
#### THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
#### WHEN prompted for the length of the password
#### THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
#### WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
#### THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
#### WHEN I answer each prompt
#### THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
#### WHEN all prompts are answered
#### THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
#### WHEN the password is generated
#### THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
